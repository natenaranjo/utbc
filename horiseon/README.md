## Project Description

This project was interesting I must say as it rack my brain when looking at the css style sheet.  Learning to recognize which could be grouped together and which could not.  It was more of a trial and error state.  

1. Learning about how to consolidate code syntax to reduce memory usage and more readable code.  
2. Understanding each element style syntax in the css sheet.  Place a comment above each one to describe what it doing.
3. Understanding how to create a repository in GitHub and upload our files.
4. Creating a GitHub Page for our project to display live on the web.
