# **Personal Portfolio**
## Description

  This was a week 2 challenge to create a personal portfolio using knowledge gain from the previous weeks on html and css.  This project pushed my understanding of frontend development and also enlighten on areas I need to focus on improvement. While working on this project I learned that I need to practice on:
  1. Flexbox
  2. Color Palette's
  3. Responsive Nav's
  4. A Good UI Layout
  5. Proper Information needed for a Portfolio.

  I really do enjoy working on live projects.
